# hello-world
This is my first repository.

I'm Leon Lang, 23 years old, mathematics master student from Bonn, Germany. My interests have been pure  mathematics (Algebra, Topology, Category Theory, Algebraic Geometry...) but have recently shifted, as I got interested in Effective Altruism and earning money. So now I want to learn to code, among other things.
